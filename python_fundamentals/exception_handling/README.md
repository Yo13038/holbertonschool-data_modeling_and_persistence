Introduction & Context
Real-world programs must be resilient. Inputs may be invalid, data may be missing, and operations may fail unexpectedly. Exception handling allows a program to detect errors, respond appropriately, and continue execution safely when possible.

In this project, you will learn how Python handles runtime errors and how to manage them using:

try / except
Specific exception types
else and finally blocks
Raising exceptions explicitly
The exercises are based on the existing exception-handling project (2122) and focus on writing defensive, predictable code.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Identify common runtime exceptions (TypeError, IndexError, ZeroDivisionError, KeyError).
Use try and except blocks correctly.
Catch specific exception types rather than broad exceptions.
Use else and finally appropriately.
Raise exceptions explicitly when required.
Write functions that fail safely and predictably.

General Requirements
Corrections will run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Python version used for correction: Python 3.8.x.
Every Python file must start exactly with:
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
Every Python file must:

Be executable.
End with a newline.
Be PEP8 compliant (pycodestyle 2.7.x).
No external libraries are allowed.

Unless explicitly stated, do not use broad except: blocks.
