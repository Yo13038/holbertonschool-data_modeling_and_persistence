Introduction and Context
In many programs, different objects represent variations of the same concept. For example, different geometric shapes may share common characteristics, and different types of users may share similar behavior.

Object-oriented programming allows us to represent these relationships using inheritance.

Inheritance allows a class to reuse and extend behavior from another class. A class that inherits from another class automatically receives its attributes and methods, and it can also modify or extend them.

Another closely related concept is polymorphism. Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways depending on their class.

Together, inheritance and polymorphism allow developers to design systems that are easier to maintain, extend, and understand.

In this project, you will explore these concepts by building a hierarchy of geometric shapes.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

Explain how inheritance allows classes to reuse behavior
Identify parent classes and child classes
Create subclasses that extend the behavior of another class
Override inherited methods
Understand how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call
Use isinstance() to check object relationships
Use issubclass() to check class relationships
Design simple inheritance hierarchies
Resources
Students are encouraged to consult the following resources while working on this project:

Python Documentation – Classes
Python Documentation – isinstance()
Python Documentation – issubclass()
Python Tutorial – Class Inheritance
Real Python – Inheritance and Polymorphism
Programiz – Method Overriding in Python
Experimenting with small examples in the Python interpreter can also help clarify how inheritance works.

Optional Reference
W3Schools – Python Inheritance

This resource provides simple examples that may help reinforce the concepts introduced in this project.

Class Hierarchy in This Project
Throughout this project you will progressively build the following class hierarchy:

BaseGeometry
      │
      ▼
   Rectangle
      │
      ▼
     Square
Interpretation
BaseGeometry defines behavior shared by geometric shapes.
Rectangle inherits from BaseGeometry and implements concrete behavior.
Square inherits from Rectangle and represents a more specialized shape.
Because Square inherits from Rectangle, and Rectangle inherits from BaseGeometry, a Square object can also be treated as:

a Rectangle
a BaseGeometry
This relationship enables code reuse and polymorphism, allowing programs to work with related objects through a shared interface.

General Requirements
All tasks in this project must follow these requirements unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Environment
Ubuntu 20.04
Python 3.8
Python files
All Python files must:

be executable
start with the following line
#!/usr/bin/env python3
Coding rules
All files must end with a newline
Code must follow PEP8
All modules, classes, and functions must include documentation strings
Only the Python standard library may be used unless otherwise stated
Do not use the words import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you are trying to import some modules.
To import any base class use the __import__method.
