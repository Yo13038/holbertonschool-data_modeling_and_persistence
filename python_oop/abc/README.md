Introduction and Context
In object-oriented programming, some classes are used to define a common contract for other classes.

Sometimes a class should define what behavior must exist, but not provide the full implementation itself. In Python, this can be modeled using abstract classes.

An abstract class allows you to define methods that subclasses are expected to implement. This helps create consistent designs where different objects share the same interface while keeping their own specific behavior.

A related concept is the idea of an interface. Python does not have a dedicated interface keyword, but similar results can be achieved using abstract methods or by relying on duck typing: if an object provides the required behavior, it can be used.

In this project, you will work with:

abstract base classes
abstract methods
interface-like design
duck typing
subclassing built-in classes
multiple inheritance
mixins
These tools are useful when building flexible and reusable software designs.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

explain the purpose of an abstract class
use ABC and @abstractmethod
implement subclasses that satisfy an abstract contract
understand how Python can model interfaces
explain and apply duck typing
extend built-in classes while preserving their behavior
understand the role of multiple inheritance
use mixins to add reusable behavior to a class

Concept Guide
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes
An abstract class defines behavior that subclasses must implement.

For example, a class may define a method that all subclasses must provide, while leaving the actual implementation to each subclass.

A simplified relationship looks like this:

          Animal (Abstract Class)
                 │
        ┌────────┴────────┐
        │                 │
       Dog               Cat
   (Concrete Class)  (Concrete Class)
Interpretation:

Animal defines required behavior
Dog and Cat provide concrete implementations
all subclasses share the same contract
Duck Typing
In Python, objects are often used based on what they can do, not only on what they inherit from.

Example idea:

if an object provides a method named draw(), it may be usable in a function that expects something drawable
the object does not always need to inherit from a specific class for that use case
This approach is often called duck typing.
